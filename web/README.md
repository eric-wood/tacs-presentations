### DOMinating the web

This presentation covers everything you need to know to start hacking away at websites.

I try to begin with the very very basics and it's assumed the audience knows nothing about HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The JavaScript portion is best understood with some basic programming knowledge, and functional programming experience helps :)

Please note that a large chunk of this presentation will be live coding. I'll most likely include the code here once the presentation is completed.

### Building the LaTeX thingamajig

I use [Pygments](http://pygments.org/) via the "minted" LaTeX package. Just make sure you have Pygments installed and you should be fine using a normal LaTeX distribution.

When running pdflatex make sure to include the ```-shell-escape``` flag!
