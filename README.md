# TACS Presentations

Presentations I've given for the Texas A&M Computing Society (A&M's ACM chapter)

### What this includes

Each directory is a presentation which includes the LaTeX source code for my slides along with a PDF and additional information/resources.

I'll put a README file in the directory for each presentation with information on what it contains and whatever is special about it.

### TODO

I have a couple separate repositories for other presentations. In the near future I'll probably delete those and consolidate them all here.

### GO FORTH AND HACK
